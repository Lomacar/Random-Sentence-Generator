the children have been giving a fuzzy sensation to me
New York is pretentious
Aunt Jemima will be giving toys to the Canucks
she knew how to tickle the wind
I knew that a nice poison had been killing the Borg
Fido knew that the mailman believed
the perfect special snowman melted
a Spaniard was thinking that a Spaniard was giving a Spaniard to the queens
the  communist had been thinking   about an apocalypse
I imagined that a snowman killed us 
I have written some outrageous books 
I have been happy that Aunt Jemima is shooting at the nice perfect red Canadian mailman
the Canadian poisons were killing the Spaniards
Fido was delicious
I am Canadian
I am special
the mailmen are nervous about Fido
The zombies miss you.
It has some strange ideas.
The Illuminati have been clever.
The Harlem Globetrotters are black.
