## 2.4.5
- Lexicon processing: removed retro inflections that are the same as simp.past. They are now added automatically when the lexicon is compiled. Same thing for irregular prog inflections. They now automatically receive the same retroprog inflection.
- Lexicon processing: proper nouns must also be unique, not just start with a capital letter
- Lexicon: added demonyms (nationality nouns)
- Lexicon: more feeling verbs (surprise, enrage, scare, annoy)
- Lexicon: "attack" "experience"
- Appearance: new fonts and larger text
- Constructions: fixed bug with quantifiers on unique nouns
