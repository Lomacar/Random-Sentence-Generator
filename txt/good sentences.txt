the children have been giving a fuzzy sensation to me
New York is pretentious
Aunt Jemima will be giving toys to the Canucks
she knew how to tickle the wind
I knew that a nice poison had been killing the Borg
Fido knew that the mailman believed
the perfect special snowman melted
a Spaniard was thinking that a Spaniard was giving a Spaniard to the queens
the  communist had been thinking   about an apocalypse
I imagined that a snowman killed us 
I have written some outrageous books 
I have been happy that Aunt Jemima is shooting at the nice perfect red Canadian mailman
the Canadian poisons were killing the Spaniards
Fido was delicious
I am Canadian
I am special
the mailmen are nervous about Fido
The zombies miss you.
It has some strange ideas.
The Illuminati have been clever.
The Harlem Globetrotters are black.
The truth should not exist.
I could not trick a wookie. A hungry wookie killed me.
A llama could kill a dinosaur.
Godzilla will fight with a big dinosaur.
Godzilla should fight with the Harlem Globetrotters.
You do not tickle Godzilla.
The truth seems fuzzy.
I am nervous about a number of people's bad ideas.
the fake shy communist is going to try to trick hundreds of children 
emotional people are naive 
I regret shooting myself
