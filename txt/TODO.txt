relative comparisons in restrictions, like {size: '<subject.size', thing: '!aux.case'}

Other things I said before:

-use last_obj in parse_restrictions
-filter restrictions in word getting based on word type template
-make probabilities take an array like [1,0.3], allow passing down of probs and declare make probs a property of constructions
-allow restriction to target sub-constructions like {'NP.name': 'example'} or maybe {'adj.name': 'exampley'}
