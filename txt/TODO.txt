BUG: predict/promise/prophesy randomly don't enforce future tense or prospective aspect

"an unicorn"

#passive voice

#reflexive
 - reciprocal

#prospective aspect

just, used to, about to

adverbs

#negation

other modals

light verbs

possessive pronouns

indefinite pronouns, here/there, the X one/those ones

relative clause

PP adjunct for nouns and verbs

adjective comparative and superlative

better adjective ordering

participles from verbs

'and'

#?proper semantically aware genitive noun phrases

mutators - "DEAD man", "bottle OF RUM"

#implications - for hierarchical tags, implemented within lexicon

#relative comparisons in restrictions, like {size: '<subject.size', thing: '!aux.case'}
    could be upgraded to handle math like {size: '<5+subject.size'}

?BUG: sometimes special characters disappear from restrictions like {lm.size: '>trajector.size'}
    
complex prepositions: over to, down to, up onto

3-way distinction of volition for verbs?
    "going to" keeps coming up with weird things

doors and windows are passages, but they shouldn't be volumes...

prevent sentences like "They keep stopping starting going."


Other things I said before:

-use last_obj in parse_restrictions
-filter restrictions in word getting based on word type template
-make probabilities take an array like [1,0.3], allow passing down of probs and declare make probs a property of constructions
-allow restriction to target sub-constructions like {'NP.name': 'example'} or maybe {'adj.name': 'exampley'}
